\# Crop Sentinel AI



Crop Sentinel AI combines two predictive models in the rice ecosystem:

\- \*\*Pest Risk Prediction\*\*: Classifies pest risk levels using machine learning (Random Forest).

\- \*\*Yield Forecasting\*\*: Estimates rice yield based on input efficiency and crop-specific growth stage thresholds.



This project is designed to assist farmers in making smarter, timely decisions by providing insights into both pest management and yield outcomes.

\## Features

\- Dual-model approach: pest risk classification and yield forecasting

\- Machine learning pipeline implemented with scikit-learn

\- Evaluation metrics include accuracy, F1-score, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC

\- Exported from Hex hackathon workspace to Jupyter Notebook
